#### Create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React

The board should contain 9 clickable elements in a 3x3 grid. Each element should have a class called square and could take one of the following values(X or O) when is clicked.

The game status should be inside a div element with class status.

The game status text could be one of the following: Next player: X, Next player: O, Winner: X, Winner: O, Tie.

There should be a reset button which resets all cell values. The button should have a class reset.

When the game starts the status should be Next player: X and after one of the cell is clicked the status will change into: Next player: O and so on.

The game winner is decided when the first player scores 3 marks in a row(up, down or diagonally).

If no player scores 3 marks in a row the game ends in a tie.
